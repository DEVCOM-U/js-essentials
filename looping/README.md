# Looping in JavaScript

Looping is a fundamental concept in programming that allows you to execute a block of code multiple times. In JavaScript, loops are used to iterate over arrays, objects, or any iterable data structure. The most common types of loops in JavaScript are `for`, `while`, and `do...while` loops.
